## 102. ERC20 `transfer()` and `transferFrom()`

Should return a boolean. Several tokens do not return a boolean on these functions. As a result, their calls in the contract might fail.

## 103. ERC20 `name()`, `decimals()`, and `symbol()` functions

Are present if used. These functions are optional in the ERC20 standard and might not be present.

## 104. ERC20 `decimals()` returns a `uint8`

Several tokens incorrectly return a uint256. If this is the case, ensure the value returned is below 255.

## 105. ERC20 `approve()` race-condition

The ERC20 standard has a known ERC20 race condition that must be mitigated to prevent attackers from stealing tokens.

## 106. ERC777 hooks

ERC777 tokens have the concept of a hook function that is called before any calls to send, transfer, operatorSend, minting and burning. While these hooks enable a lot of interesting use cases, care should be taken to make sure they do not make external calls because that can lead to reentrancy.

## 107. Token deflation via fees

Transfer and transferFrom should not take a fee. Deflationary tokens can lead to unexpected behavior.

## 108. Token inflation via interest

Potential interest earned from the token should be taken into account. Some tokens distribute interest to token holders. This interest might be trapped in the contract if not taken into account.

## 109. Token contract avoids unneeded complexity

The token should be a simple contract; a token with complex code requires a higher standard of review.

## 110. Token contract has only a few non-token-related functions

Nonâ€“token-related functions increase the likelihood of an issue in the contract.

## 111. Token only has one address

Tokens with multiple entry points for balance updates can break internal bookkeeping based on the address (e.g. `balances[token_address][msg.sender]` might not reflect the actual balance).

## 112. Token is not upgradeable

Upgradeable contracts might change their rules over time.
