## 19. Integer overflow/underflow

Not using OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeMath (or similar libraries) that check for overflows/underflows may lead to vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior if user/attacker can control the integer operands of such arithmetic operations. Solc v0.8.0 introduced default overflow/underflow checks for all arithmetic operations.

## 20. Divide before multiply

Performing multiplication before division is generally better to avoid loss of precision because Solidity integer division might truncate.
