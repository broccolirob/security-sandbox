# Message Calls

## Controlled delegatecall

`delegatecall()` or `callcode()` to an address controlled by the user allows execution of malicious contracts in the context of the callerâ€™s state. Ensure trusted destination addresses for such calls.

## Reentrancy vulnerabilities

Untrusted external contract calls could callback leading to unexpected results such as multiple withdrawals or out-of-order events. Use check-effects-interactions pattern or reentrancy guards.

## ERC777 callbacks and reentrancy

ERC777 tokens allow arbitrary callbacks via hooks that are called during token transfers. Malicious contract addresses may cause reentrancy on such callbacks if reentrancy guards are not used.

## Avoid `transfer()` / `send()` as reentrancy mitigations

Although `transfer()` and `send()` have been recommended as a security best-practice to prevent reentrancy attacks because they only forward 2300 gas, the gas repricing of opcodes may break deployed contracts. Use `call()` instead, without hardcoded gas limits along with checks-effects-interactions pattern or reentrancy guards for reentrancy protection.
