## 128. Guarded launch via asset limits

Limiting the total asset value managed by a system initially upon launch and gradually increasing it over time may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits.

## 129. Guarded launch via asset types

Limiting types of assets that can be used in the protocol initially upon launch and gradually expanding to other assets over time may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits.

## 130. Guarded launch via user limits

Limiting the total number of users that can interact with a system initially upon launch and gradually increasing it over time may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits. Initial users may also be whitelisted to limit to trusted actors before opening the system to everyone.

## 131. Guarded launch via usage limits

Enforcing transaction size limits, daily volume limits, per-account limits, or rate-limiting transactions may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits.

## 132. Guarded launch via composability limits

Restricting the composability of the system to interface only with whitelisted trusted contracts before expanding to arbitrary external contracts may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits.

## 133. Guarded launch via escrows

Escrowing high value transactions/operations with time locks and a governance capability to nullify or revert transactions may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits.

## 134. Guarded launch via circuit breakers

Implementing capabilities to pause/unpause a system in extreme scenarios may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits.

## 135. Guarded launch via emergency shutdown

Implement capabilities that allow governance to shutdown new activity in the system and allow users to reclaim assets may reduce impact due to initial vulnerabilities or exploits.
